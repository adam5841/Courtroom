# Courtroom

Courtroom provides matchmaking services in order to match clients and pro-bono lawyers/defense attorneys. Clients would submit a basic overview of their case and situation 
that lawyers would be able to filter through. Lawyers will have a profile describing their expertise and ratings that previous clients can give.
